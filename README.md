# Learn the markdown writing thing

[Lien vers la rubrique help the GitHub sur le markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#headings)

## 1. There are some buttons for Bold, Italic, Quotes... at the top (normally)

## 2. Headings
Headings is marked with # for title 1, ## for title 2, ### for title 3 etc

## 3. Paragraphs
Just going to the next line will make the text continue on the same line -> Leave a line blank to go to the line, and an extra line for a separate paragraph.

Line 1.
Now I write on the line below.

Now I left 1 line blank.

Note: the number of lines left blank does not matter, it will always make a paragraph.

Note 2: No need before or after a heading, the text goes to the line even without a blank line.

## 4. Styling
**Bold** is marked with \*\*text\*\*

*Italic* is marked with \*text\*

**Bold _and_ italic** is marked with \*\*\_text\_\*\*

~~Strikethrough~~ is marked with \~~text\~~

## 5. Links
It can link to a web page or to a place in the text. Text to be between [] then link right after between ()

\[Text that will be shown\]\(url\)

## 6. Lists
- With bullets: use - like I did here
- with numbers: well, use a number!
- nested list: use space characters in front of the nested list item, until the - lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.
  - it will be like this
    - then like this
- tasks list: use [ ] for an empty box and [x] for a checked box

## 7. Mention someone so they get a notification
Use @ and the name of the person

## 8. Emojis :smile:
Use the emoji code between : :, for example \:smiile\:
To find the emoji code, use the [cheat sheet here](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)
    
## 9. Ignore Markdown formatting
Use \ before each Markdown character (not before the whole line like a comment)
